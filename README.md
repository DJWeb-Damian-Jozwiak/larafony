# Larafony

![Larafony Logo](logo.png)

**Larafony** is a modern, lightweight PHP framework that combines the **developer experience of Laravel**, the **robustness of Symfony**, and the **power of PHP 8.5** — all without compromise.  
It’s designed for **production-grade applications**, not tutorials or demos.

## ✨ Key Features

- **⚙️ Built on PSR Standards**  
  Full support for **PSR-7 (HTTP)**, **PSR-11 (Container)**, **PSR-15 (Middleware)**, and **PSR-3 (Logger)**.  
  Interoperability at its core — use any compliant library or component you prefer.

- **🧩 Attribute-Based Design**  
  Fully powered by **PHP Attributes**, bringing clean syntax and native reflection instead of verbose annotations or configuration files.

- **🔓 Not Locked into One Ecosystem**  
  You’re free to choose your tools. Larafony works seamlessly with:
    - **Inertia.js**
    - **Vue.js**
    - **Blade**
    - **Twig**

- **🪶 Minimal Dependencies**  
  A **minimal `composer.json`** — PSR packages only. No unnecessary framework bloat.

- **🧱 Custom Middleware Stack**  
  A powerful yet simple **middleware pipeline**, inspired by PSR-15 and fine-tuned for performance.

- **📊 Built-in Backend Analytics**  
  Privacy-friendly, **cookie-free analytics**, with no dependence on Google or external trackers.

- **Production-ready from day one**
- **Framework-agnostic mindset**
- **Performance-first architecture**
- **Readable, modern PHP code**

### 🧩 The Philosophy of the Final Chapters

**This will be updated while following packages reach FULL php8.5 support.**

Larafony’s journey doesn’t end with writing code — it ends with understanding.

The last chapters are not about adding features, but about **liberating the developer**.  
They show that every component — clock, container, logger, cache, or view — is *optional*, replaceable, and interchangeable.

Each replacement (Carbon, Monolog, Laravel Container, Twig, etc.) isn’t a “plugin”, but a **lesson**:
> how professional PHP code achieves the same result through different abstractions.

By the time you reach the end, you won’t just *use* a framework —  
you’ll **understand the architecture behind every framework**.

> "The best framework is the one you can replace piece by piece — because you understand it completely."

---

🧠 **Larafony is not just a framework.**  
It’s an open architecture, a teaching tool, and a manifesto of modern PHP.

Every line of code exists to remind you that:
- elegance is a function of simplicity,
- performance is a side effect of clarity, and
- real mastery means knowing when to write less.

Welcome to the end of the framework —  
and the beginning of **your own**.

### ⚙️ Extending with mature Libraries
- [ ] View Bridges (Twig & Smarty) — Chapter 33
- [ ] Use Carbon instead of ClockFactory — Chapter 34
- [ ] Use Monolog — Chapter 35
- [ ] Replace Container with Laravel Container — Chapter 36
